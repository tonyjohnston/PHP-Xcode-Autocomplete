### What is it?

A mostly complete set of snippets covering the entire PHP language. Based on https://github.com/antmat/XcodePHP, and converted to .codesnippet files using https://github.com/ppm/TextMacro2Snippet. 

I have done some basic cleanup, but it could probably still use more.

### (Possible) Build Requirements

* Xcode 4.x +

### How to Use

1. Download the .zip.

2. Copy all files from the CodeSnippets directory to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets

3. Close Xcode if it's open and restart it.

4. Open a PHP project or file in Xcode.

There are over 5,000 snippets related to editing .php files. Voila! PHP autocomplete with tokens and structure.

### Contribute

Names can be cleaned up, summaries added, and updates for the latest version of PHP can be based on the basic structure of these documents.
	
Enjoy!
